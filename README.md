## Limitations

* Currently only the **English**, **German**, **Russian** and **French** client are supported for auto-equip  
(Send an edited version of the en.lua from the addon folder if you want your language to be supported!)
* Not (yet) supported arenas/trials: MSA, DSA, VH
* There is a **30s cooldown when changing cp**, so don't be surprised if the change is delayed sometimes.
* Features like equipping gear and spells are **not working in combat**.
